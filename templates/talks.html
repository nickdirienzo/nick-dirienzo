    <p>I gave talks on Python and web development using web.py</p>
    <p>My first BarCamp talk will be at <a href="http://barcamproc.org/" target="_blank">BarCamp Rochester</a>. I'm going to be talking about how to organize a hackathon; I'm just trying to come up with a catchy title before I say I'm doing a talk on the BarCamp Rochester site.</p>
